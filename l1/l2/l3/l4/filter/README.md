# Filters for GitHub Actions

This action includes common filters to stop workflows unless certain conditions are met.

For example, here is a workflow that publishes a package to npm when the `master` branch receives a `push`:

```workflow
workflow "Build, Test, and Publish" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["Publish"]
}

action "Build" {
  uses = "actions/npm@master"
  args = "install"
}

action "Test" {
  needs = "Build"
  uses = "actions/npm@master"
  args = "test"
}

# Filter for master branch
action "Master" {
  needs = "Test"
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "branch master"
}

action "Publish" {
  needs = "Master"
  uses = "actions/npm@master"
  args = "publish --access public"
  secrets = ["NPM_AUTH_TOKEN"]
}
```

## Available filters

### deleted

Continue if the event deletes a branch or tag.

```workflow
action "deleted-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "deleted"
}
```

### tag

Continue if the event is a tag.

```workflow
action "tag-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "tag"
}
```

Optionally supply a pattern of tags to match:

```workflow
  args = "tag v*"
```

### deleted_tag

Continue if the event deletes a tag.

```workflow
action "tag-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "deleted_tag"
}
```

Optionally supply a pattern of tags to match:

```workflow
  args = "deleted_tag v*"
```

### branch

Continue if the event is a branch.

```workflow
action "branch-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "branch"
}
```

Optionally supply a pattern of branches to match:

```workflow
  args = "branch stable-*"
```

### deleted_branch

Continue if the event deletes a branch.

```workflow
action "branch-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "deleted_branch"
}
```

Optionally supply a pattern of branches to match:

```workflow
  args = "deleted_branch stable-*"
```

### ref

Continue if the event ref matches a pattern.

```workflow
action "branch-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "ref refs/pulls/*"
}
```

### label

```workflow
action "label-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "label urgent"

### action

Continue if the event payload includes a matching action.

```workflow
action "action-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "action synchronize"
}
```

This also supports multiple actions.

```workflow
action "action-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "action 'opened|synchronize'"
}
```

### actor

Continues when the initiator of a workflow matches a GitHub username.

```workflow
action "actor-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "actor octocat"
}
```

This also supports multiple possible actors:

```workflow
action "actor-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = ["actor", "octocat", "torvalds"]
}
```

### not

Used to provide the logical opposite of other filters.

```workflow
action "not-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "not actor octocat"
}
```

### environment

Continue if the event payload includes a matching environment.

```workflow
action "environment-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "environment production"
}
```

This also supports multiple environments.

```workflow
action "environment-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = ["environment", "staging", "production"]
}
```
### merged

Continue if the pull request is merged & closed.

```workflow
action "merged-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "merged true"
}
```

```workflow
action "merged-filter" {
  uses = "actions/bin/filter@master"
  args = "merged false"
}
```
